    "description": "I designed the RemindMe cube prototype to assist dementia patients with their daily routine by providing a compact cloud-enabled cube. The cube can be set to softly pulse and play music at certain times of day, or based on smart-home triggers (such as a positional sensor) to remind the patient of their goal. I implemented it with an IOT-enabled microcontroller and full Alexa integration through Amazon AWS.",
